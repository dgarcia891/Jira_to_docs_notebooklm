# Retrofit Prime Directives
1.  **The Hippocratic Oath:** First, do no harm. Do not delete files or change logic you do not fully understand.
2.  **No "Vibe Coding":** You must verify the current behavior via `grep` or `cat` before proposing a change. Do not guess what the code does [Source 316].
3.  **The 500-Line Limit:** If a file > 500 lines, you CANNOT edit it directly. You must propose a refactor strategy first [Source 442].
4.  **Supabase Safety:** `db push`, `db reset`, and `migration` commands are FORBIDDEN. You may only generate SQL files [Source 1416].
